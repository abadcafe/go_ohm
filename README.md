Object to redis hash mapping. Use go's struct tag to indicate how to
map a struct field to a redis hash field. And includes `reference`
directive, which likes SQL's `ForeignKey`.

See [![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/abadcafe/go_ohm.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/abadcafe/go_ohm) to get more information.
